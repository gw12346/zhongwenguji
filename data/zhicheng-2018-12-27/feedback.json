How did you feel about the test?

Good

What did you like about the test?

* Easy to use
* Useful if I'm learning chinese. It would be nice to use if it told me how much english I know it would be good too because english is my foreign language. For someone who is learning chinese it's very useful.
* It's fun as well. It's like a little fun test for yourself

What did you dislike about the test?

* It would be nice if you could find the definitions for the other characters
* There's that random thing that popped (unknown character)

How accurate do you find your results?

* I don't know, it's hard to say
* I think it does reflect...because I don't know what the average is. Maybe if you could...but that's hard.
* Subjectively I think it's very accurate. Objectively I don't know.
* For me it went from quite easy characters to really obscure characters quite quickly
* I think it's better than the old app (the UI)

Now that you have these results, what would you like to do with them?

* i'd like to use it to show off
*If i'm learning chinese, I can use this as a way of measuring my progress
