How did you feel about the test?

For me it's a test of how may characters I know. It's an indication of how many characters I know and how many I don't know. Then it's a good way to know what kind of characters I don't know and how I'm going to study them.

What did you like about the test?

* It's very straightforward
* If I know a character it's very easy to indicate that I know
* If I'm unsure about a character, it's good that I can look it up before I indicate that I know or don't know

What did you dislike about the test?

* It would be good in the dictionary to provide a word that the character goes with. Like an example rather than just one character.

How accurate do you find your results?

* Pretty much what I would expect I know

Now that you have these results, what would you like to do with them?

* Now that I know which characters I don't know, I can study them.
* This is especially good because they are rarely used in normal conversation so now I know which ones to study.
