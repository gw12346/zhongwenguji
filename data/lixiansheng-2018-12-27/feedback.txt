How did you feel about the test?

Stressed. It's easy to use though.

What did you like about the test?

* I can see the meaning if I'm not sure
* I like that it's easy to use
* The test feels a bit shorter. I've done the english one before and it felt like it is forever

What did you dislike about the test?

* It makes me feel stressed because of the word "testing" (the "test status" display)

How accurate do you find your results?

* I have no frame of reference

Now that you have these results, what would you like to do with them?

* I will strike up a conversation with people about how many chinese characters I know

What if I see and it's right, I can't flip it to the right then can I?
How many chinese characters are there total?
